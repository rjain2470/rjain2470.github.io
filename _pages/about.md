Hello! My name is Ritik, and I am a second year PhD student in mathematics at the [University of Connecticut](https://uconn.edu/). Before UConn, I studied applied mathematics at [Fordham University](https://www.fordham.edu/), and graduated summa cum laude in Spring 2024. My research interests are in number theory, machine learning, and formal mathematics. 

You can contact me via email at <a href="mailto:ritik.jain@uconn.edu">ritik.jain@uconn.edu</a>.
