Hello! My name is Ritik, and I am a PhD student in mathematics at the [University of Connecticut](https://uconn.edu/). I earned my master's degree in math from UConn in December 2025. Before UConn, I studied applied mathematics at [Fordham University](https://www.fordham.edu/), and graduated summa cum laude in Spring 2024. My research interests are in number theory, machine learning, and formal mathematics.
