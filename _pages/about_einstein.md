Hello! My name is Ritik, and I am a second year PhD student in mathematics at the [University of Connecticut](https://uconn.edu/). In December 2025, I earned my master's degree en route to my PhD. Before UConn, I studied applied mathematics at [Fordham University](https://www.fordham.edu/), graduating _summa cum laude_ in Spring 2024. My research interests are in number theory, machine learning, and formal mathematics.
